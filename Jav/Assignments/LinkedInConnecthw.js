// Good Afternoon Karene,

// My name is Maurice Thomas and I was one of the Nebula Academy students sitting in on your lecture on December 3rd.  
// Thank you so much for taking the time to educate us on the interview process of obtaining employment. 
// This is a new field for me, and it was interesting to learn the streamline of the interview as well as some of the specific things that companies look for when hiring.  
// If possible, I would like to know if it would be ok to reach out to you if I have any additional questions in relation to obtaining employment in the field.  
// Thank you once again for your time.

// Best Regards,
// Maurice J Thomas
